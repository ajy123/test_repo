1433364420302884868 2021-09-02 09:41:23 +0000 <chrisfaye622> Again, CNN spreading lies. “Scientists say”. That doesn’t make it so. Science has to be provable facts, not a vote. Man, so far can not affect weather or climate. If we could desserts would be rainforests. A volcanic eruption causes more change than man ever could.  https://t.co/ycBi079cfI | 1 replies 1 retweets 2 likes

1433248958919364610 2021-09-02 02:02:34 +0000 <Maria_26596243> Everyone, please be safe.  The weather in the Northeast US is no joke right now.  Where I am in NYC, the wind isn’t howling anymore but it’s still pouring rain, which means most highways/roads are flooded.  Take shelter, be careful and stay safe.🙏🏾 | 6 replies 1 retweets 26 likes

1430487979089403905 2021-08-25 11:11:26 +0000 <TJWOX> @Michael76644644 @BuffRumblings I agree to an extent. I worry about it going out of bounds though…one errant kick and your gains can be wiped out. I know you mentioned consistency but weather, score etc will dictate when / if it can be attempted. Teams (Pats) may almost certainly chance it going out as well. | 0 replies 0 retweets 1 likes
